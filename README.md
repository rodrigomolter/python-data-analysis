# Data Analysis with Python

This project is focused on practicing data analysis using Python. The primary tasks include reading data from CSV files, performing various analyses, and visualizing the results through different types of graphs.

All the needed requirements are in the `requirements.txt`. I recommend using a [virtual environment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/).
